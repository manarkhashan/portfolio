      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I‚Äôm a 23-year-old published author with a deep passion for storytelling in all its forms. My debut poetry collection, <strong>Ghost Poetry</strong>explores raw emotion and the human experience. Currently, I‚Äôm working on my first fantasy novel, <strong>Anguish</strong> the first installment in a planned six-book series, and immersive game world.</p>
      <p>My storytelling strengths lie in branching dialogue, emotional depth, cinematic pacing, and vivid worldbuilding. I love crafting characters that feel real, flawed, layered, and alive.
