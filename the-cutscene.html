  <h1>Chapter 33: Kane Finds Maria and the Baby</h1>
  <h2>17 July · 13:00 · Kane</h2>

  <p>-knock- -knock-</p>
  <p>The air around me suddenly feels stiff, empty. No one answered the door, so I try again. I knock, wait for an answer, then repeat the cycle.</p>
  <p>By the fifth time, my patience had grown thin. What was taking so long? They must be here, I see her horse, I see his lights on. It shouldn't be a long journey to get from his kitchen to the front entrance. His cottage was moderate in size.</p>
  <p>My sweaty hand reaches for the doorknob, the moment it makes contact, I try to twist it.</p>
  <p>A heavy sigh escapes me, I move my hands, wiping the sweat away on my pants, but failing miserably.</p>
  <p>-click-</p>
  <p>The sound of a door being opened dances around my ears. It was left unlocked, which is not weird for a farmer. Yet this uneasy feeling deep in my pit would not leave me.</p>
  <p>I hold my breath in anticipation, for what hides behind the frame? My queen? There she will be, sitting on his sofa, safe from monsters and the dangers our island held.</p>
  <p>She will perhaps be asleep? Tired from her long journey to reach her home. To reach me…</p>
  <p>A small smile colors my cheeks, as I imagine her, sleeping soundly, wrapped tightly in a hand knit blanket, snoring softly, her hand resting atop her swollen belly, ready to burst at any second now. Waiting for me to come get her. Waiting for me to come save her.</p>
  <p>My queen will have to wait no longer. We will be reunited very soon. “I have come home, my queen.”</p>
  <p>My face fell, my mouth forming a tight line. The door now stood wide open, the house eerily quiet, this can not be normal. I couldn't see her from here, which made my heartbeat quicken, holding my breath, I called out her name, “Maria?”
</p>
</p>Again, I get no answer in return. “My love, I have come back for you.” </p>
</p>“Did you miss me as much as I have missed you?” I chuckled nervously.
</p>
</p>… nothing.
</p>
</p>I enter the humble cottage, my eyebrows raise ever so slightly, my eyes widen, as I let out an audible gasp.
</p>
</p>Chislon lay on the cold dirty floor, his hands tied to his feet. His nose… It looked out of place, bent to the side, all bloody. His lips were colored red, opened slightly, while he let out soft gasps for air, trying to free himself but failing. 
</p>
</p>He didn't notice me coming in, I looked around him. His furniture was all over the place, broken and flipped.
</p>
</p>His skin glistered in the light, body shivering, “Chislon? What happened?” his brown orbs snap up, meeting my own. 
</p>
</p>“Kane.” is all he whimpers. I rush to his side, breaking him free of his bounds. I ask, “who did this to you?”
</p>
</p>his eyes shift from side to side, trying to recall what had happened, a few tears escape him, as his lips tremble slightly. “I'm so sorry.”
</p>
</p>“What are you talking about? Just tell me who did this.” is all I ask, my voice laced with confusion and concern.
</p>
</p>“I failed you. I promised to help, but I failed you. No wonder you didn't want me to come along previously.” His voice cracks while he whispers softly.
</p>
</p>my eyebrows twist, my nostrils flutter, “stop speaking in riddles. You have nothing to be sorry about. Now tell me, who did this to you?” I snapped at him. I didn't mean to, but my patience was hanging by a thread thinner than a needle.
</p>
</p>“the guards,” he gulps, “I had her, she was right here. but the guards, they-“ his sentence is cut short as he stares off into the distance, shuddering, remembering the event that had transpired here.
</p>
</p>“Chislon.” I call out, his eyes snap back into mine. “All will be okay, just please let it all out. Who was here?”
</p>
</p>“Maria was here, i found her in the forest, she had given birth hours ago. so I thought she would be safe here.” My breath gets fought in my throat. Maria.
</p>
</p> I'm so close to having her safe by my side again. So close I could practically smell her divine jasmine smell.
</p>
</p>Wait, did he say she gave birth hours ago? My child was born, and I had missed his birth… I was a failure for a father.
</p>
</p>“She gave birth?” I whisper.
</p>
</p>My question goes unanswered. “The guards raided the place, they beat me up for resisting, and they took her, along with your son. I don't know what they plan to do.”  </p>
</p>“a son?” my heart swells with pride, lost in my own dream land, as I imagine what my son looks like. Does he look like her? Did he inherit her crazy wild hair? Her honey golden eyes? My perfect child, a smaller version of his mother.
</p>
</p>Or perhaps he took after me? With wild piercing green orbs, hair the color of night. I could care less who he looks more like, all I care is that he is healthy, safe in her arms. My perfect miracle.
</p>
</p>“I heard one of them say something about king Victor wanting her. I am so worried for her, she is weak and frail, she needs to rest, not go through whatever it is the king plans on doing. He is so twisted, are you sure you are his kin?”
</p>
</p>His words snap me back to reality though, what did he say? Guards took her?
</p>
</p>“My father wants her?” I question no one in particular, voicing my thoughts out loud.
“What is it with these useless guards and kidnapping my wife? I am sure she does not possess a -kidnap me-. please sign” A heavy sigh escapes me, as I massage my temples. A headache was brewing beneath the surface.
</p>
</p>The first thing I will be doing after getting her back, is packing our bags and leaving, the kingdoms and people be damned. No one is worth my wife’s suffering, not even the loyal servants, and people. They can all rot for all I care. 
</p>
</p>I might even burn it all to the ground, let them all suffer, just like she has.
</p>
</p>“Kane? Are you-”
</p>
</p>“Which kingdom is it this time? What uniform did they have on? My gods, can't they just leave us be? I am sure they have better duties to attend to.”
</p>
</p>“They were for sure from here, they were wearing brown and green armor. And they had our looks, pointy ears, long limbs. they were not human.” he stated.
</p>
</p>“Got it, I will get you your revenge, friend.” I offered him my hand, helping him up to his feet.
</p>
</p>He dusts off himself, “what do you plan on doing?”
</p>
</p>“I'm obviously going after them. Getting her back home today." I shrug.</p>
</p>“Let me get ready then.”
</p>
</p>I lifted an eyebrow in question, “No? I am going alone.” 
</p>
</p>“You can't be serious.” He looks at me like I've gone mad, his head tilted sideways, questioning my sanity.
</p>
</p>“What?” is all I ask. “I'm wasting precious time here, I have to get going.” I turn on my heels, ready to leave and go after them.
</p>
</p>He grabs onto my forearm, pulling me back towards him, his head pumps on my chest, as he grumbles, then stumbles backwards, still holding on to me, “at least let me help you!” 
</p>
</p>I yank my arm hard, freeing myself from his grasp. It makes me stumble a little, but I catch myself before I land on my face. “Chislon, look at the state of you. You are in no condition to fight. So I beg of you, stop wasting my time.”
</p>
</p>He's now walking in circles, going from corner to corner, his palms pulling hard on his brown braids. He bends down picking up his furniture, or at least what's not broken off of them.
 “Just go.” he whispers.
</p>
</p>I hesitate, “will you be okay?”
</p>
</p>“Just go Kane. She needs you. She misses you.” his back is turned to me, as he leans on his bed frame, his arm wrapped tightly around his midsection.
</p>
</p>“I will come back to see you after all is said and done.”
</p>
</p>His head snaps in my direction, his golden eyes ablaze, “Just go!”
</p>
</p>I nod slightly, turn towards the door, and sprint. it feels as if I'm flying, I run as swift as the wind.
</p>
</p>My feet were carrying me far and fast. Until they came to a halt. My chest heaving, up and down. It's hard to get my breathing under control with the scene I stumbled upon.
</p>
</p>“THE NEW HEIR IS BORN.” 
</p>
</p>What? My eyes snap up, then down again.
</p>
</p>There in front of me, people all around, from Ouphes, and Alexandria. There they all stood, roaring loudly, all that could be heard was their blood curdling screams. Cheering, happy.
</p>
</p>The castle stands proud in the distance, my eyes widen, as my heart stops beating at the sight on top of the roof. My father yelling proudly, as loud as he could, while he held an infant. My son.
</p>
</p>My body trembles, a fire ignites itself inside my frozen heart, setting my nerves aflame. 
</p>
</p>He had his dirty hands wrapped around my son’s stomach, holding him up from under his armpits. He had him held up high, shaking him from side to side, screaming in his ears, showing him off for everyone to see, all while he cried his heart out.
</p>
</p>My eyes drift sideways. My heart flutters, there she was. Kneeling on the hard stone floor, while crying her eyes out, she was sobbing loudly, I couldn't hear her, but I could see her. “Maria,” I breathe out.
</p>
</p>My eyes darken, when one of the knights steps forward, as he takes a fistfull of her perfectly messy chestnut hair. He yanks her head backwards, she screams in agony. My heart breaks at her anguish.
</p>
</p> she clasps her hands together, praying loudly, begging the monster for mercy, while he jumps and shouts around with my son still in his arms. All while she's forced to watch.
My arm stretches out, they are so close yet so far out of reach.
</p>
</p>I pushed my way in, shoving people who stood in front of me. I glanced all around me, a ginger bastard had his fist held up high, while he roared cheerfully.
</p>
</p>There to his side, stood another version of him, although he had the decency to look conflicted, seemed even a little sad.
</p>
</p>I look to my right, a crazy woman jumping around happily. While to her side stood a small family, the woman sniffling loudly while her husband embraced her and their child closer to him. Comforting them.
</p>
</p>I see two muscular men pumping their fists high, their laughter higher than most of the screams. 
</p>
</p>All around me, the people seem to be divided, some watch in horror, while the others watch in glee.
</p>
</p>In the distance, my father steps closer to the edge, hanging my son up above nothing, so high up in the air. 
</p>
</p>A burst of energy escapes me, my powers going haywire, “NO!” 
</p>
</p>Knives of fire and wind burst their way through a small group of people. They all drop dead within seconds, the handsome curly black haired guy who stood cheering now lay dead. His brunette friend falls on his knees, pleading to the gods, “my gods, take me too, reunite me with him. let my brother wait for me in the afterlife.” The raven haired guy would not be waiting for long, as his friend falls down on top of him, meeting the same fate.
</p>
</p>The ginger guy soon followed. One by one, five of them fall. 
</p>
</p>Yet the people take no notice, they step close, trembling over the dead, as they cheer on the misery of the living.
</p>
</p>“STOP,” my hoarse voice goes on unanswered, I keep pushing people out of my way. Small knives keep bursting out of me, as if having a mind of their own. 
</p>
</p>They settled down, there in front of me, stood a tall wooden blank. The castle entrance.
