  <h1>Chapter Twenty-Nine – Dream Sequence</h1>
  <h3>Kane | 17 July | 11:00</h3>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Content Warning:</strong><br />
    This scene includes grief-related trauma, death of a child (in a dream), psychological horror, and emotional breakdown. Reader discretion is advised.
  </div>

  <div class="section-title">Gameplay Breakdown:</div>
  <p><strong>Scene Type:</strong> Cinematic dream → surreal horror sequence</p>
  <p><strong>Format:</strong> Begins as non-interactive cutscene, transitions into limited player control (e.g. walking, reaching for loved ones, begging)</p>

  <p><strong>Player Prompts:</strong></p>
  <div class="choice">
    • [Hold Her Hand]<br />
    • [Call Out to Son]<br />
    • [Stay in the Dream]
  </div>

  <div class="section-title">Horror Escalation:</div>
  <p>Environment decays in real-time. Maria and the child’s bodies shift visually — blood leaks, cracks form on skin, color drains.</p>

  <div class="section-title">Tied to Choice:</div>
  <div class="consequence">
    <strong>If the player chose rage/torture earlier:</strong> the dream is darker, longer, and Maria blames Kane directly.
  </div>
  <div class="consequence">
    <strong>If the player showed mercy:</strong> the dream softens — Maria embraces Kane before fading, offering some closure.
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <h3>Full Scene</h3>
    <p>“Please go away, five more minutes” I murmur, my voice thick with sleep, as I try to get whatever this annoying thing poking my face as far away from me.
</p>
    <p>I was deep in my head, dreaming of a future I will never get to have. 
</p>
    <p>my wife. My beautiful wife, standing there in a field filled with green and rainbows, a bulky hat sat on top of her head, being held down with one of her hands, her messy hair looks even messier as it blows away in the wind. Her other hand rests gently on her swollen belly. 
</p>
    <p>My son is screaming playfully and laughing loudly, as he runs around his mother, she shares his laughter, a big smile colors her face as her pearly white teeth shine in the sun.
</p>
    <p>i took a closer look at my son, he looks so much like his mother. soft yet messy brown curls sit on top of his head, he had large hopeful hazel eyes, his cheeks colored red from all the laughing he was doing. A smile breaks on my face as I take in the scene.
</p>
    <p>“Kane? Come join us.” soft eyes look at me, her arm extended towards me, as i take her hand in mine, she pulls me in.
</p>
    <p>my arms wrap around her as I embrace her. I squeezed her tightly, bringing her even closer to me. If I could, I would open up my heart and let her lay there comfortably, safe and sound, away from this cruel world. My nose nuzzles her hair, I inhale deeply as her scent fills my lungs. The smell of comfort, warmth, and love. the smell of home.
</p>
</p>tears sting my eyes, feeling safe in her arms, feeling my heart finally at peace.
</p>
    <p>“I love you. I am so sorry my love, for all that you have suffered because of me. I promise you, my goddess, I will never let you go again. Just please stay in my arms, never leave me again.” I sob loudly, she would never judge me for feeling so deeply.
</p>
    <p>her soft hands reach my face, as she pulls it towards her, “why are you crying? i’m safe, you’re safe, our children are safe” she says while wiping away a few tears that managed to escape me. she places my hands gently on her stomach, while looking at our son running freely all around us.
</p>
    <p>“baby, come closer, come give your father a hug” she calls tenderly. Our son rushed towards us as soon as he heard his mother call.
</p>
</p>she picked him up, placing him on her hip, his small hands reaching out towards me, telling me to hold him. I embraced my wife again, this time with our child wrapped in our arms.
</p>
    <p>I'm finally home. She's finally home.
</p>
    <p>“what did you do? Kane what did you do!” she shouts at me, i look up confused.
</p>
    <p>“Huh? what happened, my love?" I ask desperately, my voice cracking with each word.
</p>
    <p>“What did you do!” is all she manages to say. As I look down, red surrounds us, her stomach is leaking blood, my boy is lying on the ground, not breathing, and Maria is crumbling away, just like my world was.
</p>
    <p>“no! no please, please no, not again” i cry out, to no avail. “Please don’t leave me, I love you, I love you!! I promise I'll do better "I plead.
</p>
    <p>“Kane look at what you did” is all she said, a sinister smile filling her lips, her face cracked and decaying.
</p>
    <p>“no please, i didn’t do anything, i love you, i will protect you better, just please don’t leave me again” i sink onto my knees, praying for her to listen to me, to stay longer.
</p>
</p>Please, I can’t live like this anymore.
</p>
    <p>“please” i crawl closer, holding her legs tightly, afraid she would run away otherwise.
</p>
    <p>loud sobs escape me, as a gentle hand strokes my hair. “I'm sorry” is all I manage to mumble.
</p>
    <p>no one seems to be listening, all sounds around me fade away into nothing.
</p>
    <p>“Come on Kane, it’s time to wake up” I look up confused, my face full of tears as they fall freely.
</p>
    <p>“What?” is all I manage to say.</p>
    <p>“Wake up.”</p>
