    <h1>Chapter Twenty-Four: Maria’s Birth Scene</h1>
    <p class="subheading">From my WIP debut fantasy novel <em>Anguish</em> (2024)</p>
    <p class="subheading">Scene Date: 17 July · 3:21</p>

    <div class="scene-text">
      <p>Agonizing screams tear through my weak body. I no longer care if I was found or not; it is well past midnight, no sane soul should be awake at this wicked hour. I also know that no deranged soul would dare approach the screaming woman in the middle of a foggy night forest.</p>

      <p>It is his birthday today. He is finally turning twenty-five years old. Still a young man—my husband did not deserve any of this, being all alone and banished on his one day out of the whole year. It seems now that our little miracle child decided to steal his thunder some more by being born on this particular day.</p>

      <p>Yet I had no say in any of this madness, so I did the only thing I could do in my situation. I scream bloody murder and I push.</p>

      <p>My body is so weak I no longer feel it, I no longer feel myself being torn open, all I feel is numbness. He is coming, of that there is no doubt now, my beating heart was getting louder, faster.</p>

      <p>I am unsure if I am ready for this. Was motherhood even made for me? I had no clue how to care for a child. I couldn’t protect myself against kidnappers. How was I supposed to protect a child from this cruel world?</p>

      <p>The taste of salty tears and snot fills my mouth, a bitter reminder of my misery. I take a fistful of the dirt filled ground, digging my nails deep into mother nature. Cloudy eyes look up into the dark night sky, praying to whoever is willing to listen.</p>

      <p>I let a small prayer pass my lips. “Let him be safe. Protect my boy. You can have me. as soon as my son is safe, I am yours to do as you please.”</p>

      <p>No gods answer me. Deep down I know my prayer will be answered. My gift to this world will live and prosper. I care not for myself, nor for my future.</p>

      <p>Let this boy grow into adulthood. Let him pass this deafening moment. I care not for anything less.</p>

      <p>I think about my Kane again. Surely the gods knew I had him in my prayers as well. I was praying for two souls. Not one of them was my own.</p>

      <p>Shivers go up and down my body. The urge to push and push and push. It keeps getting stronger with each passing minute.</p>

      <p>Soon he shall be no longer protected with the embrace of my warm belly. Instead, he shall be embraced in the warmth of my arms and body.</p>

      <p>His little body would cling strongly against me. His mother. His creator.</p>

      <p>I try to talk again, say some encouraging words to him. I am sure he is listening to his mother, waiting to hold me, just as I am desperate to hold him.</p>

      <p>Another scream slips past my lips. I try to stop it, close my mouth, yet the screams keep coming, one after another.</p>

      <p>My voice is hoarse and rough now, each scream louder than the last, scratching my throat with each one that passes me. Ripples of pain course through my body. How can one feel so numb, yet feel with each push an agonizing pain?</p>

      <p>"How long must this go on?" I gasp, my voice barely more than a whisper as another wave of pain crashes over me, leaving me trembling and breathless. "Please, little one," I plead, my voice breaking with desperation. "Come soon to me. You don’t want your mother to suffer more, do you?"</p>

      <p>The forest seems to hold its breath, the stillness pressing in around me like a living thing. I tilt my head back, eyes searching the canopy above for some sign, some assurance that I’m not alone. The branches sway gently, their silhouettes black against the faint glimmers of moonlight, but they offer no answers.</p>

      <p>My body is no longer my own; it is his now, consumed entirely by the relentless drive to bring him into the world. I can feel him, hear him in the frantic rhythm of my heart, and yet he feels so far away.</p>

      <p>"Do you hear me, little one?" I whisper again, the words shaky, almost a prayer. "Your mother is tired... I'm so tired. Please, don’t make me wait much longer."</p>

      <p>A tear slips down my cheek, warm against the cold air, and I swipe it away with trembling fingers. "I’ve been strong for you, for us, but I’m not sure how much more I can take." My voice cracks, and I let out a shaky laugh, bitter and raw. "You’re just like your father, aren’t you? Stubborn to the very end."</p>

      <p>The gods must have heard my prayers, for with one final, desperate push, the unbearable pressure vanishes. A wave of nothingness sweeps through me, erasing the stabbing pain that had consumed every fiber of my being. Relief crashes over me like a warm tide, washing away the agony, leaving me trembling and raw.</p>

      <p>For a moment, I am suspended in the silence that follows. My body feels like a hollow shell, spent and broken, yet somehow whole. The forest around me is eerily still, as though it, too, is holding its breath. The cool night air brushes against my sweat-drenched skin, mingling with the heat of exertion that still radiates from my core.</p>

      <p>Tears stream down my cheeks, unbidden, their warmth mingling with the dirt smudged on my face. I gasp for air, my chest rising and falling in ragged bursts, but it is no longer from pain—it is from relief, from disbelief, from the overwhelming realization that the hardest part is over.</p>

      <p>Small, piercing cries shatter the stillness of the forest, bouncing off the towering trees like a melody meant only for me. The sound slices through the night, filling the emptiness around me, and my heart swells, almost too full to bear. With trembling hands, I lift the hem of my skirt, uncovering him—my son.</p>

      <p>Relief gives way to something deeper—an ache, not of pain, but of love. A fierce, unrelenting love that surges through me like fire, igniting every corner of my weary heart.</p>

      <p>There he is, impossibly tiny and breathtakingly perfect. His head is crowned with a soft tuft of black ebony hair, slick and shining in the faint light. His skin glistens, body slick with fluids, a streak of crimson painting his cheek like a warrior’s mark. His fists flail with determination, his legs kick with unrelenting strength, and his cries are fierce, defiant, and utterly alive.</p>

      <p>He is alive. He is here. He is mine.</p>

      <p>In this fragile, fleeting moment, he feels like the entire world cradled in my lap. I can barely breathe as I take him in, every detail seared into my memory—the delicate curve of his nose, the perfect pout of his tiny lips, the way his chest rises and falls with each ragged breath.</p>

      <p>A tear slips down my cheek, falling onto his tiny hand, and his fingers twitch as though reaching for me. My lips tremble into a weak smile. “You’re a fighter,” I whisper, my voice breaking with emotion. “Just like your father.”</p>

      <p>His cries soften for a moment, his head turning toward me as if he knows, as if he hears my voice and understands. My chest tightens, overwhelmed by a love so profound, so fierce, it feels like it could tear me apart.</p>

      <p>My fingers fumble as I loosen the ties of my top, the movements clumsy and slow, but the moment his little mouth latches onto me, a wave of warmth floods through me.</p>

      <p>I glance around the dark forest in a rising panic. The cold bites at the edges of the night, and I know he can’t remain exposed for long. My eyes darted to the ground, to the trees, searching for anything sharp, anything useful. The thought of leaving him even for a second fills me with dread, but necessity spurs me on.</p>

      <p>Then, I remember—the tiny, pointy brush I had tucked away, stolen in my escape. My hands shake as I reach for it, and the task of cutting the cord becomes an ordeal of patience and precision. Each movement feels like an eternity, but finally, it is done. My son is now his own little person, free of me yet still so utterly dependent. And I am myself again, though changed in ways I cannot yet fathom.</p>

      <p>Tears blur my vision as I take the hem of my dress, ripping at the fabric with more strength than I thought I had left. The bottom of my once pristine gown becomes a makeshift blanket, the torn edges fraying under my touch. Gently, I wrap it around his tiny form, tucking him close against me. I tie the fabric in a secure knot, ensuring he is warm, safe, and cocooned in the remnants of the only protection I can offer him.</p>

      <p>His cries soften, his body relaxing against mine. I watch as his eyes flutter closed, his breathing evening out into a peaceful rhythm. The forest, which had been a place of terror and isolation, now feels almost serene, as if it, too, has hushed itself in reverence of this moment.</p>

      <p>I let out a trembling sigh, my body sinking back against the ground. My arms encircle him tightly, holding him as close as I can without hurting him.</p>

      <p>I let out a shaky breath, my voice trembling as the weight of the moment washes over me. “Happy birthday, my love,” I whisper, the words carrying a world of meaning. It is not just for the tiny miracle nestled against my chest, his warmth grounding me in this surreal moment. It is also for his father, the man I ache to share this with, the man who should be here, holding us both. My words are a message carried on the night air, a vow to my son and a longing for his father, wherever he may be.</p>

      <p>My eyelids grow heavy, and for the first time in what feels like an eternity, I allow myself to rest. Just for a few minutes, I think, as the darkness of exhaustion pulls me under.</p>
