    <div class="scene-text">
      <p>Cold cobblestone dug into my skin, my blood coloring the gray stone red. The wind is blowing wildly all around me, my hair is all over the place.</p>
      <p>“THE NEW HEIR IS BORN.” screams Victor, standing proud and tall. His hand hooked underneath my son’s armpits, holding up by his midsection.</p>
      <p>Tears are streaming down my face, while I shout at him, “STOP, PLEASE STOP,” my voice goes unheard, ignored. The people roared loudly in the open courtyard, cheering as my son hangs higher than the clouds. His voice hoarse, while broken sobs escape him.</p>
      <p>“STOP THIS MADNESS, I BEG OF YOU.” A guard steps closer, taking a fistful of my hair, yanking my head backwards, forcing me to watch in horror, as he dangles my child up above the open air, while he stands right at the edge of the roof.</p>
      <p>“Shut up, the king ordered for you to stay quiet.” An unfamiliar voice whispers, his voice carrying in the wind, reaching my ears through the sea of madness and cheers.</p>
      <p>My hands clasped together in prayer. “Please gods, let this torment end, let us be finally free. I will give you my life, just set him free.” I chant a prayer. Then I keep praying, I don’t stop, not for one second.</p>
      <p>The crowd is still going wild. Victor comes closer, holding my son nearby. “Let go of her hair.”</p>
      <p>As if a spell has been broken, my locks are free. My head still pounding, but it no longer aches.</p>
      <p>“Here, take him. Hold him close. If you drop him, you will hang for all to see while your body rots. Am I understood?” The guard gulps loudly, his shaky hands extending to take my son, clenching him close to his body.</p>
      <p>“Now you. What to do with you.” I look around me, trying to see who he’s talking to. My eyes land on his green orbs. He's looking straight into my soul, a wicked twisted smile fills his face.</p>
      <p>He steps closer, his crotch right in front of my forehead. His arm reaches out, cupping my cheeks harshly, his thumb stroking up and down.</p>
      <p>I flinch, my body trembling, bile threatens to come up, but I force it down.</p>
      <p>“What am I to do with you?” he whispers, crouching down. His face was so close to mine, his breath hitting my cheeks. His eyes searched my face.</p>
      <p>“Let me go, I'm begging you, let us go.” I pleaded with him, voice laced with despair and desperation.</p>
      <p>He throws his head backwards, laughing loudly, “Let you go?”</p>
      <p>“Yes, let me and my child leave. I will get out of your hair, just let us walk free.”</p>
      <p>His mouth forms a straight line, while his eyebrows twist in anger. His fingers dig deeper into my skin, squishing my cheeks, “No.”</p>
      <p>My voice hoarse and broken, I question him, “No?”</p>
      <p>“Exactly. No.” He pats my cheeks lightly. His thumb traveling downwards, till it reaches my lips. He parts them slightly, shoving his disgusting finger in.</p>
      <p>I try to bite down, but he holds my face tighter, forcing me to stay still. A new river of tears streams down my face.</p>
      <p>“Ugghg.” I tried to speak, his finger blocking my words in.</p>
      <p>“You know, I like you. I don't want to have to kill you.” he whispers softly.</p>
      <p>“Mughhh.” He chuckled, finding my silence amusing.</p>
      <p>“I can offer you a deal. Marry me, divorce that useless husband of yours. You will be a princess no longer, you will be a queen.” My eyes widen, my heart thumping loudly against my ribcage.</p>
      <p>“I won't let anyone hurt you. Not Alexander, not anyone. What do you say?” His finger slips out of my mouth, traveling downwards, leaving a trail of spit from my lips to my chin.</p>
      <p>“Marry me, you and your son will live a life of luxury.”</p>
      <p>I spit in his face. “Not in your wildest dreams, Kane will come for me.”</p>
      <p>My cheek stings, my head falling sideways, as a palm connects with it.</p>
      <p>No air is entering my lungs, his hand is wrapped around my throat, squeezing. “You whore. You should be more appreciative of people who try to help you. Kane is dead, get that through your thick head. Now you will join him in the halls of hells.”</p>
      <p>My arms reach up, clawing at his hands, my face turning purple from the lack of airflow. My head feels heavy, as black spots dance around my vision.</p>
      <p>“Plea-please.” I plead. He only laughs.</p>
      <p>“You had your chance, whore. Say hello to my son when you see him down below.”</p>
      <p>“Please,” I gasp, “my son.” I point his way with a shaky finger. “His mother.” That same shaky finger finds its way towards my chest. My words are making no sense, my brain scrambling to spit out as much as it can manage, before it suffocates.</p>
      <p>“What do you think he needs you for? Kane grew up with no mother, and look how he turned out. A fearful warrior. Before you turned him weak and pathetic.”</p>
      <p>Soft whistling sounds escape me, wheezing when I try to speak. My arms fall slack, my body goes numb.</p>
      <p>“You should have thought about this before you rejected me. You could have had it all.” My head pops from side to side, trying my hardest to stay awake.</p>
      <p>Just when darkness was about to consume me, the sound of a bang ran loudly in the air. The sound of a door slamming hard against stoney walls.</p>
      <p>My eyes roll into the back of my head, my whole body going fully limp.</p>
