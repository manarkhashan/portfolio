  <h1>Chapter Twenty-Five – Interrogation Scene</h1>
  <h3>Kane | 17 July | 4:45</h3>

  <div class="warning">
    <strong>Content Warning:</strong><br />
    This scene contains graphic depictions of torture, emotional abuse, grief-related trauma, mentions of fetal/infant death, gore, and psychological horror. Reader discretion is advised.
  </div>

  <div class="section-title">Gameplay Breakdown:</div>
  <p><strong>Cinematic Setup:</strong> Kane ties up the king and begins questioning him. Dialogue plays out largely as a cutscene — players do not control Kane’s movement at this stage.</p>

  <p><strong>Branching Choice Trigger:</strong> When the king confesses that he killed Maria and their unborn child, the player is presented with a timed choice.</p>

  <div class="choice">[Prompt on screen:] What will you do?<br />
  • Show mercy — walk away<br />
  • Threaten him — demand more answers<br />
  • Let the rage take over</div>

  <div class="section-title">Consequences:</div>
  <div class="consequence">
    <strong>Mercy:</strong> The king mocks Kane later during a political standoff, undermining him. Kane retains favor with some companions but loses key information that could change his quest path.
  </div>
  <div class="consequence">
    <strong>Threaten:</strong> Kane draws blood but doesn’t go far. The king gives a partial confession, and Kane experiences guilt but remains composed. Middle-ground outcome.
  </div>
  <div class="consequence">
    <strong>Rage:</strong> Full torture scene unfolds as written. Brutal consequences. Kane’s reputation drops, companion loyalty is affected, and the following dream sequence is darker and more graphic.
  </div>

  <div class="section-title">Narrative Hook:</div>
  <p>Later in the game, players discover the king lied. This adds regret or vindication depending on their earlier choice — making it a moment that redefines how they view Kane.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <h3>Full Scene</h3>
    <p>I have been walking for what felt like hours now, I knew better than that though. The halls stretch on and on, the sick bastard's chambers nowhere in sight.</p>
    <p>I checked every room and every corner in this damned hallway.</p>
    <p>A certain door to my right calls for me, it calls my name. It has a shine to it that no other room had so far, could this be it? Could she be here? The room pulls me in like a siren pulls sailors with her song.</p>
    <p>Reaching the massive open yellow doors, I peer my head inside, it feels like I've been slapped in the face with rays of sunshine. Yellow decorates the walls, yellow fills the floor, yellow bed sheets, yellow curtains that were blowing in the wind thanks to the open window. Did they leave all their windows open? Such a weird place.
</p>
    <p>Walking closer to the bed, I see a dent left behind from whoever slept in it. Letting my hands trace the silhouette,  a brown curly hair strand stands out to me, it stands out against its bright background.
</p>
    <p>I pick it up, deep down knowing who it belongs to. Tears swell in my eyes, as I inch lower and lower, my nose now flush against the sheets, the pillows smell like her, her scent addicting. She was here, of that I am certain. Where could they have moved her…
</p>
    <p>I walked out of that room as a new man. A determined man. She is here, i now knew that, i just had to find her and bring her home with me.
</p>
    <p>Walking down the halls, I find a familiar room. Flashbacks of betrayal fill my head, as I scan the room looking for danger. I find none so I move on.
As I sneak around the corners, climbing up the stairs, I turn and find two asleep guards blocking a doorway. Who hired these people, if this was how they defended their kingdom then they were doomed to fail, these people don't deserve to rule on their own, they need an actual king. I will claim this kingdom as my own after I kill the old geezer. 
</p>
    <p>It will be my gift to my Maria. Her people back, with her as their queen.
</p>
    <p>I sneak around, get close enough to the two idiots, slit their throats, no sounds could be heard, except for their blood gushing out, painting the once gloomy bright floors a dark crimson red.
</p>
    <p>Their bodies fall with a thud, I straighten my back, look around me, to see if anyone had heard, but it seems every last person in this purgatory was under some kind of spell, all were passed out, deep in slumber.
</p>
    <p>I crack open the heavy metal door, just enough for me to sneak myself in. Right away I knew I had the right room.
</p>
    <p>Gold colored every corner, even the candles were dipped in gold, burning and shining. In the middle of the bedchamber stood a large golden bed frame, there inside it lay an old man.
a sinister smile fills my face. I found you.
</p>
    <p>Stalking closer, my lust for blood grew heavier, each step closer to that creep, was one step closer to my soul being back with me.
</p>
    <p>I'm not even going to use my powers, why waste my energy on that old creep, I'll save it for better use.
</p>
    <p>I see a scarf, laying there at his feet. My smile gets bigger and bigger, with each thought that crosses my mind, today he dies, today his reign ends. Today I set them free. Free from you.
My hands form into firm fists, twisting the scarf into both hands, as I creep closer. And finally there he lay.
</p>
    <p>I wrap the scarf around his neck, and I squeeze. His eyes fly open, blown wide with shock, his mouth gaping open, trying to scream yet no sound comes out. 
I look him dead in his panicked eyes, eyes wide open, nose flared, as I let out a low deep laugh. 
</p>
    <p>“P-please,” he struggles to get out.
</p>
    <p>‘’How pathetic can you be?” I say cheerfully.
</p>
    <p>“Worry not, your majesty, this is not how you die.” I let him know so kindly. His face was turning blue and purple at this point. His eyes finally flew back as his breathing slowed down. I soften my grip on the scarf, and let his body fall back into the soft pillow.
</p>
    <p>I take the covers off his body, hoist him up, his back touching the bed frame, as I tie his hands and legs. When he awakens, we will have a nice chit chat. He will tell me where my wife is. And I will strip him of his titles but let him live, because I am such a gracious generous leader.
</p>
    <p>I see a chair at the far end of the room, so I drag it forward, placing it beside the bed. I take a seat, crossing my legs, dusting my pants a little, trying to make myself look presentable for when he wakes up. 
</p>
    <p>I can't have this talk with him looking like a mess.
Now I just wait.
</p>
    <p>#
</p>
    <p>“Uhh” I glanced up from the book I was currently reading. I place it down beside me as I look at the king trying to come to his senses.
</p>
    <p>“Welcome back, king Alexander,” I spat out, hatred filled with each word I uttered.
</p>
    <p>“Uuhh” was all he managed to mutter, his head bobbing from side to side.
</p>
    <p>I took a fistful of his greasy hair, helping him ever so kindly hold his head up high. </p>
     <p>“What's wrong with your graciousness? Cat got your tongue?” his eyes glanced up, but did not remain on my frame long, as they wandered all around him, looking for clues on where he might be.
</p>
      <p>I yank his head backwards, forcing his eyes to set on mine. They widen with shock, dilated with fear? Excitement? I couldn't tell. The huge smile I had plastered across my face earlier made its return, as I said “hello.”
</p>
       <p>He started shaking his head, right, left, right. So I tightened the grip I had on him. I couldn't have him moving around this much if we were to have a nice conversation.
</p>
        <p>“Could you stay still for a moment? I need to have a word with you,"I say in a sing songy voice, the smile never leaving my face. My cheeks were starting to ache, but I couldn't contain it.
</p>
     <p>He stopped moving, as his eyes looked up in defeat, with nowhere else to look at, he sat, stuck there, with me holding him in place.
</p>
      <p>“That's a good boy, that wasn't too hard, was it now?” I asked mockingly. 
</p>
       <p>He had yet to say something, I let out a huff, I was growing impatient. “Say something,” I say in a deep low voice. I can see his Adam apple bobbing up and down as he takes a big gulp.
</p>
        <p>Sweat started dripping down his forehead, my hands were starting to feel slippery from the hold I had on his hair, so I let him go.
</p>
         <p>Standing up straight, I wipe my hand with his face, I give it a one pat.. Two pats. 
</p>
          <p>I take a hold of his cheeks, his mouth forming into an oh shape, I give it a squeeze. </p>
           <p>“Nooo, please Kane let me go, I'm such a good person, I'm such a good person.” I say in a high pitched voice, trying to mimic his own, while forcing his mouth to move with each word I say.
</p>
            <p></p>    
<p> “So, you're just gonna sit there and not say anything?” I let go of his face, get up and walk around a little. “You must put yourself in my shoes, it feels so awkward talking to myself, while you're just sitting there staring.”
</p>
<p>I wait for an answer… nothing.</p>
<p>“I know I'm handsome, but this is starting to creep me out, quit with all the staring.” I mumble, my fingers combing through my hair. 
</p>
<p>I turn to look at him again, “okay let's do this another way,” I say as I strike him, his head falling to the side. “You know, I tried doing this the nice way, you're just not going along with the script I had planned in my head.” I let out a sigh of annoyance.
</p>
<p>“Wha-what do you-you want?” he stuttered out. 
</p>
<p>The smile finally leaves my face, my mouth forming a thin tight line, as my eyebrows grease. “What do you think I want?” I growl. 
</p>
<p>“What? You want the whor-” his words were cut short as my fist collided with his nose, the crunch echoing in the chamber. Blood was dripping down his nose now, leaving a trail that led to his mouth, his chin, then started to drip into the fine silk sheets.
</p>
<p>“Don't you dare. you disrespect my wife again, I cut your tongue out.” I say through clenched teeth. “Understood?” he nods his head yes, then proceeds to keep nodding. 
What is it with this guy and not standing still?
</p>
<p>I took another fistful of his hair, “can you not sit still?” I asked a genuine question that I had to know the answer to. Yet I did not get my answer.
</p>
<p>“Okay I'm done playing around, where is my wife?” I ask, my voice calm and collected.
</p>
<p>His face forms into a sick twisted smile, "haven't you heard? The whor-"I look at him with sharp eyes, he reconsiders his words, then continues, “the princess is dead.”
</p>
<p>“What?” I say, no real emotion behind my words, my eyes wide in shock, my heartbeat quickens.
</p>
<p>“That can't be true,” I deny his words. 
</p>
<p>“It is. I killed her myself, right after I dragged the demon out of her womb and cut off his head.” he spat out. some of his spit hitting my cheeks.
</p>
<p>My brain can't process his words. This can't be. This is just a nightmare, i will wake up at any moment now, see her laying beside me. asleep safe and sound in my arms.
</p>
<p>But I look around me as my reality sets in, this is no nightmare, this was my life. This was one of my hells.
</p>
<p>“I won't use my powers on you, that would be a waste of energy on an undeserving rat, like you” I say calmly. “Your death will be slow, and agonizing, I will let you bleed out. I will sit here till I'm positive you are rotting. I will enjoy every second of this.” I told him my plans, I wanted him to know what was coming his way, I wanted him to squirm thinking about his very near future.
</p>
<p>I take out a dagger, force it close to his face, as I press it closer and closer to his eyes, I dig it deep into his skin, as I drag it slowly down his face, making a trailway towards his mouth. Taking a hold of his tongue, I cut it, blood started gushing out, filling his clothes and mine.
</p>
<p>He coughs, his blood splattering everything around us.
</p>
<p>I pay him no mind as I slit his throat halfway. Letting the dagger go lower, I slit his arms open, on both sides.
</p>
<p>He had open wounds everywhere on his body now. I stab the dagger deep into his thigh, and leave it there.
</p>
<p>Standing straighter, I look around me, searching the room for something to distract this ache in my heart.
</p>
<p>My eyes land on a bottle, sitting on a table in the middle of the room. I take long strides, as I reach it, I take a hold of it, open the cap, take the first swing.
</p>
<p>Walking back towards the chair I had beside his bed. I take a seat, crossing my legs again, as I take swing after swing. Watching him bleed dry.
</p>
